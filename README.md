ConnectX is more than a typical corporate directory. It is composed of three parts: 

### 1. Digital Community
  Every user has their own profile where they can specify their skills and aspirations.
### 2. Work Management
  Users can define their objectives and track their projects with workstreams.
### 3. Performance Management
  Yearly performance reviews are completed based on the employee's objectives and input collected from collaborators.
 
## My Work Samples
As a data analyst working with the product team my work can be summarized in three categories reporting, product analysis and statistical modeling.

Here are few samples of my work. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.

### 1. Reporting
Prepare excel and Power BI reports using platform data to support HR, Management, Learnings & Development or just for general use for anyone in the company.
